# CardDetails

This project was a lot harder that i thought it would be and showed how bad i actually am with JavaScript as when it came to writing the javascript side
I was lost and didnt know where to start. I attempted to add the spaces for the card number using splice but this stopped everything from working. I was
looking for a starter project for javascript to help me learn however this may have been a little too far. Also, If I was to do this again I would lay the
images out better as I ended up opting for Absolute positioning which made the responsivity very bad.
